## Pokedex Web App

This is my first project, a Pokedex web app with an account system. Created to learn the basics of front end design using React, Html, CSS.

Currently features:

User Registration and Sign In

Reactive Format/Error Messages for Login/Registration Fields

Team Generation

Display Pokemon Details

Scroll Through Pokemon

Ability to Add/Remove Pokemon from Collection/Favorites

Search Pokemon by Name

Page Scroll to Details Box When Pokemon Clicked

Display Pokemon by Generation

Display Pokemon by Type

Display Favorites

Collection Page

Loading Animation

Logout

Reactive Page Layout

To Do:
Move Login/Registration API Calls to api.js
Improve Collection Page
Improve Code Consistancy, currently some different techniquies are used as I learnt and experiemented as I went, these should be brought into stylistic alignment.
Account Deletion

Some Gameboy Pokemon CSS borrowed from https://github.com/luttje/css-pokemon-gameboy/

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
